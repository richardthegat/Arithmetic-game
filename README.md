A quick, fun, interactive python game made to practice addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It is perfect for anyone looking to sharpen their mental math skills. 

The game consists of 20 question with 5 coming from each arithmetic operation(addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). Additionally, it features dynamic question generation with random numbers, score tracking, small feedback for correct and incorrect answers, and scores based on your performance. 

The code structure is simple, with there being five relevant  functions: 

addition_game: Handles the addition portion of the game.
subtraction_game: Handles the subtraction portion of the game.
multiplication_game: Handles the multiplication portion of the game.
division_game: Handles the division portion of the game.
final_score: Calculates and displays the total score and final message.

I personally use this to keep my basic math knowledge sharp during extended breaks, and it has definitely helped.
